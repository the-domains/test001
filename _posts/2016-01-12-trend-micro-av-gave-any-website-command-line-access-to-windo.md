description: "PCs running Trend Micro's Antivirus on Windows can be hijacked, infected with malware, or wiped clean by any website, thanks to vulnerabilities in the security software. The design blunders were discovered by Google Project Zero member Tavis Ormandy. A patch is now available to address the vulnerabilities, so Trend Micro users should update their software as soon as possible."
